Can't run TensorBoard on El Captain

Got this as an issue while trying to run TensorBoard on El Captain.
python tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py
/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.10_2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file 'tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Even after following instructions here for installing tensorflow on a brew based installation of python the error remains same:
python tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py
python: can't open file 'tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
