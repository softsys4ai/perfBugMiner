typo in placeholder docs

The example code provided in the docs for the placeholder op doesn't work:
  x = tf.placeholder(float, shape=(1024, 1024))
  y = tf.matmul(x, x)

  with tf.Session() as sess:
    print sess.run(y)  # ERROR: will fail because x was not fed.

    rand_array = np.random.rand(1024, 1024)
    print sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: rand_array})  # Will succeed.
Should it be x = tf.placeholder("float", shape=(1024, 1024))?
