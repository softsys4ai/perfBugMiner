Integration with blaze ecosystem numba python to llvm compiler?

Hi Tensorflow team,
Thanks for the open source work!
I'm always on the lookout to replace lower level work with python code.   I'm therefore really excited about Numba a JIT compiler that can turn a subset of pure python syntax into really fast multithreaded compiled code across multiple backends.  There are also other cool projects that provide different abstractions and graph symbolic representations to different data backends.

I don't have any specific use cases in mind (maybe to efface c++ use?), but just wanted to make the team aware.  As a pydata user, I would love to see any  cooperation and synergy between all these amazing projects in the ecosystem.
