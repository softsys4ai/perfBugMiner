Creating a specific 3.6 binary for Linux

System information

Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 14.04
TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Source
TensorFlow version (use command below):
Python version: Python3.6
Bazel version (if compiling from source):
GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): -NA-
CUDA/cuDNN version: -NA-
GPU model and memory: -NA-
Exact command to reproduce: import tensorflow as tf

Environment capture text:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
tf_env.txt
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
This command also results in the same error.

return f(*args, **kwds)
Describe the problem
When importing tensorflow , I get this error. I found some information on "Feature request: nightly build for python 3.6 #12935" --"Yes, we unfortunately copy the 3.5 binary for 3.6 I'll look into creating a specific 3.6 binary for Linux."
Source code / logs
$import tensorflow as tf
result is
